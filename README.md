This repo contains my [automated install script for Fedora](installers/fedora.sh) and any associated files required. Currently the only one needed is the [minecraft.desktop](shortcuts/minecraft.desktop) file. I plan on adding more configurations in the future. The installer can be run using `bash ./installers/fedora.sh`. This script is tailored to my own use cases and should be modified if you are running it.
